<strong>Q: What is a safe way to update the WordPress Core if I ever need to?</strong>
A: Check out this post on our blog. http://mpswp.wordpress.com/2014/11/26/great-steps-to-follow-before-updating-your-wordpress-core/

<strong>Q: If I have an automatic plugin updating plugin installed at the same time as disabling plugin updates, what will happen?</strong>
A: Disable Updates Manager disables the parts of the update system depending on which settings update have checked. If you have the Disable All Plugin Updates setting checked at the same time as having a automatic plugin update plugin installed, then Disable Updates Manager overrides it to disable updates no matter what.

== Installation ==

1. Install Disable Updates Manager either via the WordPress.org plugin page and uploading the files to your FTP manually, or going to the and new plugins section in your dashboard.

2. Activate Disable Updates Manager by MPS Plugins.
